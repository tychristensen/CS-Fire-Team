	  <p class="para" style="font-size: 1.5vw;">You can expect this view to show your current statistics for the year including calls, shifts, work details, business meetings, leave time, and years of service. If a requirement is highlighted red with the caption, “Behind-Schedule”, you are at least 10% behind where you should be at with this requirement at this time of the year. If a requirement is highlighted yellow with the caption, “Falling-Behind”, you are behind where you should be at this point in the year, but only by less than 10%. If a requirement is highlighted green with the caption, “On-Track”, you are at or ahead of where you should be with this requirement at this point in the year. If a requirement is highlighted blue with the caption, “Complete”, you have met this requirement for the year :). Your leave days and years of service are highlighted gray and do not have an affect on your overall status. Note that the leave value displayed refers to the number of leave days you have attained in the current calendar year. </p>

	  <h2>Custom Reports</h2>
	  <p class="para" style="font-size: 1.5vw;">Your officers have the ability to generate detailed reports regarding your progress on specific requirements. For example, if you think you are missing a work detail credit, you can ask your officer to run a custom work detail report on you. This will list each recorded work detail associated with you in our database. </p>
