	  <h2>Intro</h2>
	  <p class="para">The Bridge ™ software is designed to integrate the data gathered by the Golden Fire Department and represent it in a meaningful way. As an administrator, you can update the status of personnel to reflect leave time, allowing them to generate an accurate LOSAP report. You can run reports on individuals, groups, or the entire staff to see where the department stands in terms of progress towards fulfilling requirements. Additionally, as an administrator you can upload data to the system at any time on the imports page and view overarching departmental statistics on the home page.</p>

	  <p class="para">This view will show you department-wide statistics including the proportion of staff that is on-track, behind, falling-behind, or complete with their requirements. You can customize the date-range for which the data is generated. Keep in mind, however, that the personnel requirement status data in the pie chart will always be generated as a year-to-date.</p>

	  <h2>Reports</h2>
	  <p class="para">This feature is only available to officers and administrators. This view allows you to select a date-range, group of individuals, and report type and run a report. This report is then downloaded to your computer as a csv file. Standard reports contain information regarding calls (actual and total), shifts (including bonus shifts), work detail hours, sundays/dailies/weeklies, fundraisers, business meetings, and days/years of service. Additionally, there is a column indicating if the individual is on-track, behind, falling-behind, or complete with their requirements. </p>
